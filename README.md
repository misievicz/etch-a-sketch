finish 'Etch-a-sketch' project

Learnt a lot, most important stuff was function scope and values returned. First 'serious' solo DOM manipulation. Based on 'flex' method. Propably not the most productive one, but I'm glad how I managed to make it work. Also wanted to practice with flex more. 'elemement.children' saved my sanity.
